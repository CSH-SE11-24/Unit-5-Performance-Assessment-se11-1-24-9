My html is my home page that allows you to navigate through the crimes of trains in nyc subways
My research page shows the new dangerous trend led by nyc teenagers that puts lives at stake it is led by two buttons of differnet asthetics
My solutions page shows how we can take a rise to this asnd gives some feedbcak to this rising problem
My stats page give sintel about the new change enforced in nyc subways and why it has been placed
The rest of my js are in aolder and are capable of handling my events.Javascript made my project more interative as most users dont only like reading tetx but like seeing differnet varities of software enginerring
Im most proud of my index html page necause i think it was cool that i let people navigate theough it and there isnt any platforms that allow you too see the crimmes of different traisn since its a broad network
If i had more time i would fix the sizing and try narrowing down the javascript features to one to two html pages
